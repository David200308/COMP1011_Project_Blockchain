SHA1_Demo.cpp
This file contains the sample logic of how to generate a 160-bit hash value based on a string. The output is represented as a 40-character string, with each character representing a hexadecimal value. Each hexadecimal value is equivalent to 4 bits. For example, ‘7’ means 0111 and ‘B’ means 1011. You DO NOT have to modify this file.
